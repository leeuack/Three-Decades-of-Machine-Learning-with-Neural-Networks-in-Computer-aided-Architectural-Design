5,"Increasing implementation of digital tools within a design process generates exponentially growing data in each phase, and inevitably, decision making within a design space with increasing complexity will be a great challenge for the designers in the future. Hence, this research aimed to seek potentials of captured data within a design space and solution space of a truss design problem for proposing an initial novel approach to augment capabilities of digital tools by artificial intelligence where designers are allowed to make a wise guess within the initial design space via performance feedbacks from the objective space. Initial structural design and modelling phase of a truss section was selected as a material of this study since decisions within this stage affect the whole process and performance of the end product. As a method, a generic framework was proposed that can help designers to understand the trade-offs between initial structural design alternatives to make informed decisions and optimizations during the initial stage. Finally, the proposed framework was presented in a case study, and future potentials of the research were discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
