5,"The composite photoreceptive field of the human eye receives photons emitted from a source and converts this energy into image information within the brain. The internal mechanisms of the contemporary camera imaging technologies represent yet another in a long history of attempts to technically replicate this procedure. The critical difference between the capacity of the human eye to receive quanta events or photons and that of a camera transmitting to a digital display device, rests in how much of the original signal can be recovered. This paper aims to show how the information deficit associated with this technological conversion can be enhanced by the deliberate exploitation and re-arrangement of the cameras image sensor mechanism. The paper will discuss how the mapping of pixel grid geometries and colour filter array patterns at the vastly increased scale of building façades, imparts a materiality to urban form that modifies the visibility and performance of the corresponding virtual screen image. The exploration of the material adaptation of pixel geometries leads to a new technique that extends the working gamut of pixel-based RGB colour space and both establishes an index to develop material performance criteria and modifies the limitations of traditional viewing technologies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
