5,"Robotic 3D printing applications are rapidly growing in architecture, where they enable the introduction of new materials and bespoke geometries. However, current approaches remain limited to printing on top of a flat build bed. This limits robotic 3D printings impact as a sustainable technology: opportunities to customize or enhance existing elements, or to utilize complex material behaviour are missed. This paper addresses the potentials of conformal 3D printing and presents a novel and robust workflow for printing onto unknown and arbitrarily shaped 3D substrates. The workflow combines dual-resolution Robotic Scanning, Neural Network prediction and printing of PETG plastic. This integrated approach offers the advantage of responding directly to unknown geometries through automated performance design customization. This paper firstly contextualizes the work within the current state of the art of conformal printing. We then describe our methodology and the design experiment we have used to test it. We lastly describe the key findings, potentials and limitations of the work, as well as the next steps in this research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
