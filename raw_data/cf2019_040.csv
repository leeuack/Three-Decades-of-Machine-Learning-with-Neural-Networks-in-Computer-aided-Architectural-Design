5,"When we want to know satisfaction of audiences in a speech, the questionnaire survey is the most affordable method to collect quantitative data. However, the reliability and validity of the questionnaire is closely related to the design of the questions and the attitude of the respondents. Photos can capture nonverbal behaviors of the audience while listening to a speech. At that time, the audience did not hide their emotions. In this paper, we organize the photos of the three speeches hosted by the NCKU Art Center in 2016 as the data set. We found that the results of the behavioral analysis in photos are similar to the statistical results of the questionnaire. Finally, we made some suggestions for using the photos to analyze the nonverbal behavior of audiences and for establishing a database of nonverbal behaviors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
