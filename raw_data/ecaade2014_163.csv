5,"A procedure for generating 3-dimensional spatial configurations for optimization applications, termed Dimension Constrained Rectangular Voronoi Diagram (DC-RVD), is presented in this paper. The procedure is able to generate a non-overlapping configuration of spatial units in 3-dimensional space, given a string of real values. It constitutes an extension and adaptation of the Rectangular Voronoi Diagram generating procedure, found in the work of Choi and Young (1991). An extensive description of the procedure, with the relevant pseudocode is included in the paper. The procedure is tested in a stochastic optimisation-based decision support environment. Testing is done using a case study of a medium-sized family house. The result indicate promising performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
