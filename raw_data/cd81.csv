4,"The paper presents a progress report on a project investigating the possible application of a framework for cooperative-activities of computer design agents in the conceptual phase of architectural design. A process leading to definition of the expected performances of design agents is desribed, and some possible applications illustrated. The framework includes not only the objective, but also, the ""subjective"" agents. It is expected that the framework would offer an insight into the intricacies of CAAD in an educational environment, and provide the exploration paths and an efficient production of alternative solutions in an office.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
