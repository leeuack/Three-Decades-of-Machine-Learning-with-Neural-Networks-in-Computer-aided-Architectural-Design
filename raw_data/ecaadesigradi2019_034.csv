5,"How can machine learning be combined with intelligent construction, material testing and other related topics to develop a new method of fabrication? This paper presents a set of experiments on the dynamic control of the heat deflection of thermoplastics in searching for a new 3D printing method with the dynamic behaviour of PLA and with a comprehensive workflow utilizing mechanic automation, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, this paper will discuss in-depth the performance of different types of neural networks used in the research and conclude with solid data on the potential connection between the structure of neural networks and the dynamic, complex material performance we are attempting to capture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
