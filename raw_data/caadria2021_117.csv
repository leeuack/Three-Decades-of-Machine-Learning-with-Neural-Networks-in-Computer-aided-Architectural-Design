5,"Information extracted from aerial photographs is widely used in the fields of urban planning and architecture. An effective method for detecting buildings in aerial photographs is to use deep learning to understand the current state of a target region. However, the building mask images used to train the deep learning model must be manually generated in many cases. To overcome this challenge, a method has been proposed for automatically generating mask images by using textured 3D virtual models with aerial photographs. Some aerial photographs include thin clouds, which degrade image quality. In this research, the thin clouds in these aerial photographs are removed by using a generative adversarial network, which leads to improvements in training accuracy. Therefore, the objective of this research is to propose a method for automatically generating building mask images by using 3D virtual models with textured aerial photographs to enable the removable of thin clouds so that the image can be used for deep learning. A model trained on datasets generated by the proposed method was able to detect buildings in aerial photographs with an accuracy of IoU = 0.651.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
