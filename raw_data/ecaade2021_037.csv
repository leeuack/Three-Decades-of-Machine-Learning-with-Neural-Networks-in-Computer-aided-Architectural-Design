5,"In redevelopment projects in mature cities, it is important to visualize the future landscape. Diminished reality (DR) based methods have been proposed to represent the future landscape after the structures are removed. However, two issues remain to be addressed in previous studies. (1) the user needs to prepare 3D models of the structure to be removed and the background structure to be rendered after removal as preprocessing, and (2) the user needs to specify the structure to be removed in advance. In this study, we propose a DR method that detects the objects to be removed using semantic segmentation and completes the removal area using generative adversarial networks. With this method, virtual removal can be performed without preparing 3D models in advance and without specifying the removal target in advance. A prototype system was used for verification, and it was confirmed that the method can represent the future landscape after removal and can run at an average speed of about 8.75 fps.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
