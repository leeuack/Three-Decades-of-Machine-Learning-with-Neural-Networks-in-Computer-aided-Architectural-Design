5,"There has been an exponential increase in Machine Learning (ML) research in design. Specifically, with Deep Learning becoming more accessible, frameworks like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which are able to synthesise novel images are being used in the classification and generation of designs in architecture. While much of these explorations successfully demonstrate the 'magic' and potential of these techniques, their limits remain unclear, with only a few, but crucial, discussions on underlying fundamental limits and sensitivities of ML. This is a gap in our understanding of these tools especially within the complex context of planning and architecture. This paper seeks to discuss what limits ML in design as it exists today, by examining the state-of-the-art and mechanics of ML models relevant to design tasks. Aiming to help researchers to focus on productive uses of ML and avoid areas of over-promise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
