5,"The paper presents a blueprint of a simulation model and structures the processing of information that sensors in real life would provide to improve the efficiency of the cooling system and increase the thermal comfort of occupants in an outdoor environment. It outlines an evidence-based technique for evaluating perceived benefits that would arise from the introduction of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Computational Techniques (CTs) to evaporative cooling systems. The initial results indicate how data that would be gathered by sensory devices on occupancy and microclimatic conditions can be employed for the prediction and optimisation of the system to narrow the time gap between peak usage and nozzle activation to minimise resource use and maximise occupants' comfort. The larger objective of the study to help mitigate the effects of rising temperatures in urban environments and support the future use of outdoor public spaces. In the longer run, the study aims to explore the role of computationally enhanced microclimate control at a large scale, integral to innovative approaches to outdoor public spaces design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
