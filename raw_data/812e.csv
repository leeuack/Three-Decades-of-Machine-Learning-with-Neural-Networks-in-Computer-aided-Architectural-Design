Specifically, a computer system that generates 3D city modelsfrom satellite images is formulated, implemented, and tested. Techniques from neural networks, fuzzysystems, image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning constitute the methodologicalfoundation of the system. The usability and flexibility of the system are evaluated in case studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
