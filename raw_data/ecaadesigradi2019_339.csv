5,"In this study, we developed a method for generating omnidirectional depth images from corresponding omnidirectional RGB images of streetscapes by learning each pair of omnidirectional RGB and depth images created by computer graphics using pix2pix. Then, the models trained with different series of images shot under different site and weather conditions were applied to Google street view images to generate depth images. The validity of the generated depth images was then evaluated visually. In addition, we conducted experiments to evaluate Google street view images using multiple participants. We constructed a model that estimates the evaluation value of these images with and without the depth images using the learning-to-rank method with deep convolutional neural network. The results demonstrate the extent to which the generalization performance of the streetscape evaluation model changes depending on the presence or absence of depth images.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
