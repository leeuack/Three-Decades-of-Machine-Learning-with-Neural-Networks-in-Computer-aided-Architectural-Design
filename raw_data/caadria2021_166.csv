5,"This paper introduces a method to obtain quantified style description vector which is for computer analysis input by using image style classification task. In the experiment, 3331 architectural photos of three styles obtained by crawling and filtering were used as training data. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to map architectural images to high-dimensional feature space, and then the high-dimensional style description vector was used to output the measurement results of style cognition with fully connected neural network. Tested by test data-set of 371 architectural pictures, the accuracy rate of style cognition reached more than 80%. The neural network using architectural data training was applied to the style cognition of non-architectural objects, high accuracy rate was also achieved, it proved that this quantified style description vector did include the information about style cognition to some extent instead of simply classification. Finally, the similarities and differences between the cognitive characteristics of style of neural network and human beings are investigated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
