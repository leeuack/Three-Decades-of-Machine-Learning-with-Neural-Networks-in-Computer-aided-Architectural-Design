5,"The main pedestrian entrance of the building site has a direct influence on the use of the buildings, so the selection of the main pedestrian entrance is very important in the process of architectural design. The correct selection of the main pedestrian entrance of building site depends on the experience of designers and environment data collected by designers, the process is time consuming and inefficient, especially when the building site located in complex urban environment. In order to improve the efficiency of design process, we used online map to collect museums information in China as training samples, and constructing artificial neural networks to predict the direction of the main pedestrian entrance. After the training, we get the prediction model with 79% prediction accuracy. Although the accuracy still need to be improved, it creates a new approach to analysis the main pedestrian entrance of the site and worth further researching.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
