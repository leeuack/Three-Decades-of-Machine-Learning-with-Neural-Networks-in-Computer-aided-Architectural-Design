5,"This paper describes an experiment where an imagerecorded with a digital camera is processed using anelectro-physiological model of a neuron. Theluminosity level of each pixel of the source image istreated as the stimulus for an individual neuron, andthe source image is transformed into a responseimage based on the processing behavior of theHodgkin-Huxley neuronal model. It is seen thattransformation of the image through neuronalprocessing yields (i) more evenly balanced levels ofluminosity and (ii) a more subjective rendering of theenvironment than what was photographed with thedigital camera.The CCD (charge coupled device) based digital camera reveals its limitation as a linearrecording device that does not have a balanceddynamic range.The neuronal processing of the imageadds non-linearity and a balanced range to theluminosity levels in the image, rendering it closer to asubjective perception of the scene.",,,,,,,,,,,,
