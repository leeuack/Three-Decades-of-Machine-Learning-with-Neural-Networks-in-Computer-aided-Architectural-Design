5,"Simulated Annealing is an artificial intelligence algorithm for finding the optimal solution of a proposition in an ample search space, which is based on the similarity between the physical annealing process of solid materials and the combinatorial optimization problem. In architectural layout design, although architects usually rely on their subjective design concepts to arrange buildings in a site, the judging criteria hidden in their design concepts are understandable. They can be summarized and parameterized as a combination of penalty and reward functions. By defining the functions to evaluate a design plan, then using the simulated annealing algorithm to search the optimal solution, the plan can be optimized and generated automatically. Six penalty and reward functions are proposed with different parameter weights in this article, which become a guideline for architectural layout design, especially for residential area planning. Then the results of several tests are shown, in which the parameter weights are adjusted, and the importance of each function is integrated. Lastly, a recommended weight and ""temperature"" setting are proposed, and a system of generating architectural layout is invented, which releases architects from building arranging work in an early stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
