This reference provides information needed to choose the most appropriate of the many available techniques for a given class of problems. The latest edition includes explanations of classical and new methods, including neural networks, stochastic methods, genetic algorithms, and theory of learning. It provides algorithms to explain specific pattern-recognition and learning techniques as well as appendices covering the necessary mathematical background."
