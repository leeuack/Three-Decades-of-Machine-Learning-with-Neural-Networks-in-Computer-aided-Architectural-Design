5,"When multi-axis processing machines are employed for high-mix, low-volume production, they are operated using a dedicated computer-aided design/ computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) process that derives an operating path concurrently with detailed modeling. This type of work requires dedicated software that occasionally results in complicated front-loading and data management issues. We proposed a three-dimensional (3D) shape recognition method based on deep learning that creates an operational path from 3D part geometry entered by a CAM application to derive a path for processing machinery such as a circular saw, drill, or end mill. The methodology was tested using 11 joint types and five processing patterns. The results show that the proposed method has several practical applications, as it addresses wooden object creation and may also have other applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
