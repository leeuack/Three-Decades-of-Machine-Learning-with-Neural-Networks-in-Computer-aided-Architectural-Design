5,"The BIM modeling process is the most time-consuming aspect. This paper studies the possibility of applying the recognition and segmentation of architectural components by deep learning to assist automatic BIM modeling. The research has two parts: the first one is dataset preparing, that images with the labeled architectural components from an original CAD drawing are made for the network training, and second is training and testing, that a mature network which has been trained in hundreds of labeled images is used to make predictions. The utilization of the current study results is discussed and the optimization method as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
