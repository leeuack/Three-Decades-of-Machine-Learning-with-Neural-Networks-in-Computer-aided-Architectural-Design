4,"Human beings learn to communicate through mutual eflorts to develop shared understandings within a given context. With neural network technology, computers may learn to identify objects and behaviors in the CAD context by which they may understand the needs of designers. This capability can enable the computer to respond adaptively to assist individual users."
