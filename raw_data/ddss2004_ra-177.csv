5,"This paper discusses the potential of a spatial microsimulation-based decision  support system for policy analysis. The system can be used to describe current  conditions and issues in neighbourhoods, predict future trends in the  composition and health of neighbourhoods and conduct modelling and  predictive analysis to measure the likely impact of policy interventions at the  local level. A large dynamic spatial micro-simulation model is being  constructed for the population of Leeds (approximately 715,000 individuals)  based on spatial microsimulation techniques in conjunction with a range of  data, including 2001 Census data for Output Areas and sample data from the  British Household Panel Survey. The project has three main aims as follows:  (i) to develop a static microsimulation model to describe current conditions in  Leeds; (ii) to enable the performance of What if? analysis on a range of  policy scenarios; and (iii) to develop a dynamic microsimulation model to  predict future conditions in Leeds under different policy scenarios.  The paper  reports progress in meeting the above aims and outlines the associated  difficulties and data issues. One of the significant advantages of the spatial  microsimulation approach adopted by this project is that it enables the user to  query any combination of variables that is deemed desirable for policy  analysis. The paper will illustrate the software tool being developed in the  context of this project that is capable of carrying out queries of this type and of  mapping their results. The decision support tool is being developed to support  policy-makers concerned with urban regeneration and neighbourhood renewal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
