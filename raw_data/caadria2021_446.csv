5,"The goal of the research is to investigate an AI approach to assist architects with multimodal inputs (sketches and textual information) for conceptual design. With different textual inputs, the AI approach generates the architectural stylistic variations of a users initial sketch input as a design inspiration. A novel machine learning approach for the multimodal input system is introduced and compared to other approaches. The machine learning approach is performed through procedural training with the content curation of training data in order to control the fidelity of generated designs from the input and to manage their diversity. In this paper, the framework of the proposed AI approach is explained. Furthermore, the implementation of its prototype is demonstrated with various examples.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
