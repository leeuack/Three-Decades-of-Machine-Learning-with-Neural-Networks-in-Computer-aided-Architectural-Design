5,"In this paper we propose an automatic layout algorithm using PBD (Position-Based Dynamic) for large-scale office park planning. Typically, the organization of buildings into a layout is a labor-intensive problem, and takes up most of designers working time. Unlike Evolutionary Algorithms who has high computational cost, and GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) whose constraints are not explicit, PBD can handle complex geometric constraints fast enough to be used in interactive environments. The high efficiency will not only accelerate the design iteration from draft to drawings, but also provide precious feasible sample for performance optimization. Furthermore, PBD is intuitive and flexible to be implemented which makes it a potential technique to be used in real design workflow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
