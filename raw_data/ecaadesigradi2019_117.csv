5,"The use of mixed reality (MR) for landscape simulation has attracted attention recently. MR can produce a realistic landscape simulation by merging a three-dimensional computer graphic (3DCG) model of a new building on a real space. One challenge with MR that remains to be tackled is occlusion. Properly handling occlusion is important for the understanding of the spatial relationship between physical and virtual objects. When the occlusion targets move or the target's shape changes, depth-based methods using a special camera have been applied for dynamic occlusion handling. However, these methods have a limitation of the distance to obtain depth information and are unsuitable for outdoor landscape simulation. This study focuses on a dynamic occlusion handling method for MR-based landscape simulation. We developed a real-time semantic segmentation system to perform dynamic occlusion handling. We designed this system for use in mobile devices with client-server communication for real-time semantic segmentation processing in mobile devices. Additionally, we used a normal monocular camera for practice use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
