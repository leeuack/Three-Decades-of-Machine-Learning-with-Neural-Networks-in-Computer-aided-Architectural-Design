5,"Nowadays, numerous researchers emphasize the significance of the environmen-tal performance-driven generative methodology. However, due to the complex coupling mechanism of environmental regulation factors, the existing optimiza-tion engines and applications are time-consuming and cumbersome. In this re-search, we propose a novel design methodology based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). This paper is divided into 3 sections, including theoretical framework, design strategy, and practical application. It first introduces an over-view of basic principles, illustrating the potential advantages of DRL in perfor-mance data-driven design. Based on this, the paper proposes a DRL-based gener-ative method. We point out a more specific discussion about the application and workflow of core DRL elements in architectural design. Finally, taking a grid-form urban space composed by multitude high-rise building blocks as an exam-ple, we present a application through a DRL agent to conduct numerous active wind environmental performance-based design tests. It is an interactive and gen-erative design method, owning multiple advantages of timeliness, convenience, and intelligence.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
