5,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), based on interpretation of data, influences various professions including architectural design today. Although research on integrating conceptual design with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms as a subset of the AI has been investigated previously, there is not a framework towards integration of architectural geometry with material properties and structural performance data towards decision making in the early-design phase. Undertaking performance simulations require significant amount of computation power and time. The aim of this research is to integrate ML algorithms into design process to achieve time efficiency and improve design results. The proposed workflow consists of three stages, including generation of the parametric model; running structural performance simulations to collect the data, and operating the ML algorithms, including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Non-Linear Regression (NLR) and Gaussian Mixture (GM) for undertaking different tasks. The results underlined that the system generates relatively fast solutions with accuracy. Additionally, ML algorithms can assist generative design processes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
