5,"In this chapter, transition rules used in urban CA models are reviewed and classified into two categories: transition potential rules and conflict resolution rules. Then, four widely used rule elicitation methods: Regression analysis, Artificial Neural network (ANN), Visual calibration, and Analytical Hierarchy Processing - Multi Criteria Evaluation (AHP-MCE) are discussed. Most of these methods are data driven methods and can be used to elicit the transition potential rules in the urban CA models. In the following, three possible rule elicitation methods:  Interview, Document analysis, and Card sorting are explained and demonstrated. These three methods are driven by knowledge and can be used to elicit conflict resolution rules as well as transition potential rules in urban CA models."
