5,"An emerging need for interactive architecture is currently making buildings mutable, flexible in use, and adaptable to changes in climate by introducing robotic systems. However, the feasibility of the seamless integration of building construction details and kinetic robotics has become a critical issue for developing robotic architecture. The objective of this work is to develop a robotic architecture with an emphasis on the integration of cellular robotics with a distributed kinetic building surface. The kinetic building surface integrates an actuating system, a localization and remote control system, which become part of the kinetic building system. This paper presents a systematic framework by reviewing theories and related work of robotic architecture and automated control. An architectural design scheme is proposed to simulate a scenario of application in a physical space. The functionality of the electrical and control system and the integration of the effects of actual construction were examined by a prototype of a kinetic surface. Our prototype presents a feasible construction method, and a prominent energy-saving effect. The potential strength and restrictions of the cellular robotic approach to architectural applications are discussed. The applicability of the prototype system and issues about controlling the behavior of spatial robots are demonstrated in this paper.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
