5,"This paper focuses on the development of a knowledge model in the context of energy efficiency and indoor climate interventions, their impacts on each other and on architectural design preferences (for instance architectural expression or any spatial functionality aspect) via an existing house case study. In addition, it attempts to discuss how this type of model can be a reference for a decision support tool and be applied to the (re)design of dwellings. The model is considered to provide an integral knowledge base for the design professional both to evaluate existing designs and to use it as a support during design and decision making in order to reach the best possible solution, with optimal performance in terms of indoor comfort, energy-efficiency and overall design performance. In other words, its aim is to enable the assessment of the performance of the end result with respect to design choices, beforehand. In this paper, design performance is modeled by means of fuzzy logic operations. It is a method to deal with subjective and vague requirements such as low energy consumption, low overheating risk, high comfort, etc. The method of intelligent information processing is explained and a partial application is presented.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
