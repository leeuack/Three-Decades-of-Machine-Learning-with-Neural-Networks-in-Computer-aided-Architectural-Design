4,"This paper describes a CAAD teaching strategy in which some Artificial
Intelligence techniques are integrated with 3D modelling exploration. The
main objective is to lead the students towards ""repertoire"" acquisition and
creative exploration of design alternatives. This strategy is based on
dialogue emulation, graphic precedent libraries, and 3D modelling as a
medium of design study.The course syllabus is developed in two parts: a first stage in which the
students interact with an intelligent interface that emulates a dialogue.
This interface produces advice composed of either precedents or possible
new solutions. Textual descriptions of precedents are coupled with
graphical illustrations and textual descriptions of possible new solutions
are coupled with sets of 3D components. The second and final stage of
the course is based on 3D modelling, not simply as a means of
presentation, but as a design study medium. The students are then
encouraged to get the systems output from the first stage of the course
and explore it graphically. This is done through an environment in which
modelling in 3D is straightforward allowing the focus to be placed on
design exploration rather than simply on design presentation. The
students go back to the first stage for further advice depending on the
results achieved in the second stage. This cycle is repeated until the
design solution receives a satisfactory assessment."
