5,"A systematic approach for the application of AI-based information processing for information ordering in architectural building design is described. For this purpose fuzzy associative memory (FAM) method is considered. In this system FAM is used for knowledge representation in building design concerning the functional & technical requirements information and its graded relevance to individuals concerned in the same context. A set of FAM rules having been established as a knowledge base for use, a pattern of information in the form of a fuzzy vector is fed to each FAM rule. Here, a decision support system is aimed to convey the information to the respective individuals and/or bodies involved, in a graded form, according to their capacity of involvement in the building design. By exploiting the binary logic, each FAM rule is fired in parallel but to a different degree so that each rule generates an m-dimensional output fuzzy vector Pi. The union of these vectors creates m-dimensional fuzzy decision vector D that provides the ordered information addressed to respective individuals and/or bodies mentioned. Using simulated data, a verification procedure for the performance of the approach is investigated and by means of the work, the role that artificial intelligence in architecture and building design might play, is pointed out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
