4,"A computer aided design (CAD) system that can store the design knowledge of users is proposed. Specifically, a computer system for generating 3D city models from satellite images is formulated, implemented and tested. Techniques from neural networks, fuzzy systems, image processing, pattern recognition, and machine learning constitute the methodological foundation of the system. The flexibility and usability of system are evaluated."
