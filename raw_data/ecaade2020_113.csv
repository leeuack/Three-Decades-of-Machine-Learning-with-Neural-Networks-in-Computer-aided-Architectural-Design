5,"Although it is widely known that the walkability of urban street plays a vital role in promoting street quality and public health, there is still no consensus on how to measure it quantitatively and comprehensively. Recent emerging deep learning and sensor network has revealed the possibility to overcome the previous limit, thus bringing forward a research paradigm shift. Taking this advantage, this study explores a new approach for urban street walkability measurement. In the experimental study, we capture Street View Picture, traffic flow data, and environmental sensor data covering streets within Osaka University and conduct both physical and perceived walkability evaluation. The result indicates that the street walkability of the campus is significantly higher than that of municipal, and the streets close to large service facilities have better walkability, while others receive lower scores. The difference between physical and perceived walkability indicates the feasibility and limitation of the auto-calculation method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
