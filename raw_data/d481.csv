5,"This paper examines the use of dynamic learning systems and adaptive topologies within neural networks models, and their implications as a tool for architectural mappings. The principal investigation is the ability of such systems to identify/ map/ model/ represent flows within dynamic data sets and identify topological relationships between these flows.
A growing neural network [GNN] model is proposed, able to map dynamic data inputs over time. It is based on Kohonens early self-organising feature maps [SOM] and takes as its starting point previous work by CECA with neural networks in an architectural context, as well as other examples of neural gases, and GNNs, in order to develop a model capable of autopoietic behaviour and meta  learning.
The principal investigation is the ability of such a system to identify/ map/ model/ represent flows within dynamic data sets and identify topological relationships between these flows.As a case study, the proposed neural network model has been used to map urban territory, as part of an on going architectural research project, based in North London. The project takes the notion of urban territories rather than urban space as the field for interrogation, as a description of temporal spatial occupation space, rather than spatial physical permanence. 
Furthermore, the GNN may be used to identify the relationships between unused and vacant sites along the street. In this way, the GNN may become a means of proposing architectural interventions for these spaces, so that the territories of those that occupy it and the negotiations between them are not lost."
