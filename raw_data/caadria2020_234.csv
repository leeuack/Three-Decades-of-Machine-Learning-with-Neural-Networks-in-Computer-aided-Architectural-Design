5,"In recent years, a tremendous amount of progress is being made in the field of machine learning, but it is still very hard to directly apply 3D Machine Learning on the architectural design due to the practical constraints on model resolution and training time. Based on the past several years' development of GAN (Generative Adversarial Network), also the method of spatial sequence rules, the authors mainly introduces 3D architectural form style transfer on 2 levels of scale (overall and detailed) through multiple methods of machine learning algorithms which are trained with 2 types of 2D training data set (serial stack and multi-view) at a relatively decent resolution. By exploring how styles interact and influence the original content in neural networks on the 2D level, it is possible for designers to manually control the expected output of 2D images, result in creating the new style 3D architectural model with a clear designing approach.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
