4,"It seems that when architects think, and talk about computers, they only reflect on very narrow images of the phenomenon. Architects think that the impact of computers in their profession is only related to how PCs, CAD/CAM, networks, software, peripherals, can improve the way they work today. Architects, by enlarge, are unable to reflect beyond the screen of their computers and the wall of their offices when it comes to recognize the real consequences resulting from the new technological advances. In this paper we argue that we should think differently. We must recognize that computers are having much more profound impact on the profession. Computers - the technology of the fantastic, par excellence - are changing the city! They are fundamentally transforming the way we use space, and buildings! Computers are beginning to create new kinds of urban cultures and infrastructures. Building types such as offices, banks, retail spaces, and museums are being transformed into virtual workplaces, telecommuting centers, networks of automated teller machines, home banking, smart stores and multimedia experiences. Computers are transforming the concept of working, the concept of banking, the concept of shopping, etc. In the end, something fundamental about the architecture of these activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
