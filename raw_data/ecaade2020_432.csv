5,"The paper presents design-integrated methods for high-resolution specification and prediction of functionally graded wood-based thermal responsive composites, using machine learning. The objective is the development of new circular design workflow, employing robotic fabrication, in order to predict fabrication files linked to material performance and design requirements, focused on application for intrinsic responsive and adaptive architectural surfaces. Through an experimental case study, the paper explores how machine learning can form a predictive design framework where low-resolution data can solve material systems at high resolution. The experimental computational and prototyping studies show that the presented image-based machine learning method can be adopted and adapted across various stages and scales of architectural design and fabrication. This in turn allows for a design-per-requirement approach that optimizes material distribution and promotes material economy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
