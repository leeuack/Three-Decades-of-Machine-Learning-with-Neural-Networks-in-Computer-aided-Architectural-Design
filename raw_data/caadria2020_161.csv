5,"Mixed reality (MR), that blends the real and virtual worlds, attracted attention for consensus-building among stakeholders in environmental design with the visualization of planned landscape onsite. One of the technical challenges in MR is the occlusion problem which occurs when virtual objects hide physical objects that should be rendered in front of virtual objects. This problem may cause inappropriate simulation. And the visual environmental assessment of present and proposed landscape with MR can be effective for the evidence-based design, such as urban greenery. Thus, this study aims to develop a MR-based environmental assessment system with dynamic occlusion handling and green view index estimation using semantic segmentation based on deep learning. This system was designed for the use on a mobile device with video communication over the Internet to implement a real-time semantic segmentation whose computational cost is high. The applicability of the developed system is shown through case studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
