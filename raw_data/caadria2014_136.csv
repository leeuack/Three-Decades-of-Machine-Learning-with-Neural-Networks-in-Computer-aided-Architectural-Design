5,"Representational media  analogue, physical, digital, or virtual  are employed by students in the conception, development and presentation. In 2013 a survey at two architectural schools was conducted to study the current representational media use in design studios. The survey examined the role digital and physical media play in students design work and how students use the various media to generate and communicate their designs. This study presents its importance through the shift in architectural education whereby digital tools are not taught per se any longer, however expected to be mastered throughout the course. Yet students learning experiences are strongly dependant on the successful acquisition of skills and its transfer to deep learning. Especially architectural design studios build upon the premises that rerepresentation leads to a better acquisition of knowledge. Architectural educators may use the study to revisit their studio and reposition the role of media as well as align learning outcomes, deliverables and communication tools with the actual working- and learning-styles of students.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
