5,"The ability of GANs to synthesize large sets of data is ideal for coupling with BIM to formulate a multi-access system that enables users to search and browse through a spectrum of articulated options, all personalised to design specificity - an 'Architecture Machine'. Nonetheless, due to challenges in proprietary incompatibility, BIM systems currently lack a secured yet transparent way of freely integrating with crowdsourced efforts. This research proposes to employ blockchain as a means to couple GANs and BIM, with e8 networking topology to facilitate communication and distribution. It consists of a literature review and a design research that proposes a tech stack design and UML (unified modeling language) use cases, and presents preliminary design results obtained using GANs and e8.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
