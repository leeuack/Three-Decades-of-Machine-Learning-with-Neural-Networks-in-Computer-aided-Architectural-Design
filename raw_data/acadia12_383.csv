5,"This paper addresses the limited shared vocabulary of landscape architecture and architectural design, evident in the application of terms such as spatial design and spatial planning. In their current usage, such terms emphasize the visible, terrestrial, pedestrian-perspective level, often to the absolute exclusion of a spatial, i.e., volumetric comprehension of the environment. This deficit is acutely evident in the teaching of landscape architecture and architecture and discussion of these fields shared ground. The dominant document type for mapping such analysis and design is the plan, or three-dimensional representations of the same, restricted to an extrusion or height map. GIS techniques in spatial design tend to be weighted toward visual, surface-based data (slope analysis, exposure, viewshed, etc.). Within this domain, our goal is to transform aspects of the intangiblethe characteristics of open space itselfinto a form that is legible, quantifiable, and malleable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
