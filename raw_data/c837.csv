4,"Can artificial intelligence be used for design behavior of human beings?
Human designers behavior and design thinking are extremely complicated. There is
still argument about the relationship between the two until now. Therefore, this
research only investigates regular and common design behavior. This essay is taking
Mondrian of Neo-Plasticism as an example and neural networks systems as a tool to
illustrate the core idea. It is hoped that we can simulate the design thinking ability,
such as memory association and recognition of human designers. Computation of
neural networks systems, as a result and the difference between human designers and
computer, can be discussed too. Also, since the work of Neo-Plasticism Mondrian
influences contemporary architecture design, industrial design, andvisual design
directly or indirectly, floorplans of architect John Hejduks works were taken as an
example to discuss the application of Neural networkss in the design field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
