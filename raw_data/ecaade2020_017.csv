5,"As a form of visual reasoning, sketching is a human cognitive activity instrumental to architectural design. In the process of sketching, abstract sketches invoke new mental imageries and subsequently lead to new sketches. This iterative transformation is repeated until the final design emerges. Artificial Intelligence and Deep Neural Networks have been developed to imitate human cognitive processes. Amongst these networks, the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) has been developed for image-to-image translation and is able to generate realistic images from abstract sketches. To mimic the cyclic process of abstracting and imaging in architectural concept design, a Cyclic-cGAN that consists of two cGANs is proposed in this paper. The first cGAN transforms sketches to images, while the second from images to sketches. The training of the Cyclic-cGAN is presented and its performance illustrated by using two sketches from well-known architects, and two from architecture students. The results show that the proposed Cyclic-cGAN can emulate architects' mode of visual reasoning through sketching. This novel approach of utilising deep neural networks may open the door for further development of Artificial Intelligence in assisting architects in conceptual design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
