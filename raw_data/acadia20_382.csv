5,"We present a framework to generate intelligent spatial assemblies from sets of digitally encoded spatial parts designed by the architect with embedded principles of prefabrication, assembly awareness, and reconfigurability. The methodology includes a bespoke constraint-solving algorithm for autonomously assembling 3D geometries into larger spatial compositions for the built environment. A series of graph-based analysis methods are applied to each assembly to extract performance metrics related to architectural space-making goals, including structural stability, material density, spatial segmentation, connectivity, and spatial distribution. Together with the constraint-based assembly algorithm and analysis methods, we have integrated a novel application of deep reinforcement (RL) learning for training the models to improve at matching the multiperformance goals established by the user through self-play. RL is applied to improve the selection and sequencing of parts while considering local and global objectives. The users design intent is embedded through the design of partial units of 3D space with embedded fabrication principles and their relational constraints over how they connect to each other and the quantifiable goals to drive the distribution of effective features. The methodology has been developed over three years through three case study projects called ArchiGo (20172018), NoMAS (20182019), and IRSILA (2019-2020). Each demonstrates the potential for buildings with reconfigurable and adaptive life cycles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
