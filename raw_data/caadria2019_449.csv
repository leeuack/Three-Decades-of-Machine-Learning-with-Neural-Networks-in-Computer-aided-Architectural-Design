5,"As the medium of the environment, a building's environment performance-based generative design cannot be separated from intelligent data processing. Sustainable building design should seek an optimized form of environmental performance through a complete set of intelligent induction, autonomous analysis and feedback systems. This paper analyzed the trends in architectural design development in the era of algorithms and data and the status quo of building generative design based on environmental performance, as well as highlighting the importance of physical experiments. Furthermore, a design method for self-generating environmental performance of urban high-rise buildings by applying artificial intelligence neural network algorithms to a customized physical wind tunnel is proposed, which mainly includes a morphology parameter control and environmental data acquisition system, code translation of environmental evaluation rules and architecture of a neural network algorithm model. The design-oriented intelligent prediction can be generated directly from the target environmental requirements to the architectural forms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
