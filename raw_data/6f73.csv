4,"The architectural research on provision of computational support for the building delivery process in general and computer aided performance modeling in particular has traditionally concentrated on the building design phase. This paper argues that computational modeling can also successfully apply to the building operation phase. To demonstrate this potential the paper explores a simulation- assisted building control strategy. Specifically, the use of generate-and-test as well as bi-directional inference methods is proposed to derive preferable control schemes and required attributes for control variables based on parametric and iterative simulation runs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated via illustrative computational examples from the thermal control domain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
