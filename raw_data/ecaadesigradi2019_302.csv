5,"The permeation of various fields by the applications of artificial intelligence (AI) has arrived in the collective consciousness and is increasingly present in the physical world. Current results of AI research in the field of architecture illustrate that already today within every step of the architectural conception and fabrication approaches towards their automation are being made. Even the very human features of motivation and creativity aren't left untouched anymore. This paper discusses, on the basis of different concepts and examples, up to what extent the contemporary possible implementations of AI and their underlying algorithms are able to conquer the architectural profession. Furthermore, it presents a summary of an automation-concept for the whole profession.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
