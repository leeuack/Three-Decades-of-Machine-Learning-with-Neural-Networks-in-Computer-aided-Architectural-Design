5,"Simple and common architectural elements can be combined to create complex spaces. Different spatial compositions of elements define different spatial boundaries, and each produces a unique local spatial experience to observers inside the space. Therefore an architectural style brings about a distinct spatial experience.
While multiple representation methods are practiced in the field of architecture, there lacks a compelling way to capture and identify spatial experiences. Describing an observers spatial experiences quantitatively and efficiently is a challenge. In this paper, we propose a method that employs 3D isovist methods and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve recognition of local spatial compositions. The case studies conducted validate that this methodology works well in capturing and identifying local spatial conditions, illustrates the pattern and frequency of their appearance in designs, and indicates peculiar spatial experiences embedded in an architectural style. The case study used small designs by Mies van der Rohe and Aldo van Eyck.
The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it introduces a sampling method based on 3D Isovist that generates a 2D image that can be used to represent a 3D space from a specific observation point. Second, it employs a CNN model to extract features from the sampled images, then classifies their corresponding space. Third, it demonstrates a few case studies where this space classification method is applied to different architectural styles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
