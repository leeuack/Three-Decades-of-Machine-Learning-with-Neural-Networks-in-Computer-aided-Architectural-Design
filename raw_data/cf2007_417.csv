This allows the tool to improve the effectiveness of designers in their design tasks over time. Design experiments evaluate the effectiveness of this prototype system in recognizing optimization problems in heterogeneous design scenarios.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
