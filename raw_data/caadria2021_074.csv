5,"Nowadays, climate problems, such as urban ventilation, heat island effect are becoming increasingly serious. Performance-oriented buildings that respond positively to the environment are constructing a sustainable future of the living environment. This research introduces an autonomous Self-Formation Wind Tunnel (SFWT) platform based on 120 dynamic grid mechanical devices, and its building cluster morphology generation workflow in the conceptual design stage, for the rapid and mass formation experiments. The Self-formation wind tunnel plat-form, which has the advantages of both perceptive and real-time data, is able to use the techniques of machine learning to provide a new design paradigm, from environmental performance to physical morphology.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
