5,"This paper describes the method of establishing a tool, interconnecting a selection of hardware and computational software to design architecture, through the manipulation of forms using brain activities inside a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. This is achieved through the use of electroencephalography (EEG), detecting brain activities and live streaming numerical data inside VR environment. Architectural forms are manipulated and interacted live by this data stream. The paper discusses the methods, findings, technical limitations as well as potential modifications which would otherwise improve the system's performance for the intended purposes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
