5,"In this paper, we discuss a new tool pipeline that aims to re-integrate lateral thinking strategies in computational tools of architecture. We present a 4-step AI-driven pipeline, based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), that draws from the ability to access the latent space of a machine and use this space as a digital design environment. We demonstrate examples of navigating in this space using vector arithmetic and interpolations as a method to generate a series of images that are then translated to 3D voxel structures. Through a gallery of forms, we show how this series of techniques could result in unexpected spaces and outputs beyond what could be produced by human capability alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
