4,"If we assume that the statements from this quote are true, than we have to ask ourselves the question: ""Should we teach architecture as we do?"" This paper describes our experience in developing a knowledge base using a neural network system to serve as a ""intelligent assistant"" to students and other practicing architects in the conceptual phase of their work on housing design. Our approach concentrated on rising the awareness of the designer about the problem, not by building rules to guide him to a solution, but by questioning the categories and typologies by which he classifies and understands a problem. This we achieve through examples containing mutant forms, imperfect rules, gray zones between black and white, that carry the seeds of new solutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
