5,"This paper relies on observation and analysis an internationally digital design exchange activity, The FCU & Bartlett School of Architecture, university college London (UCL) digital architecture workshop to propose an educational model based on the artificial neural network (ANN). We expect that the results of this work can lead to the establishment of a scoring mechanism that can ""adapt"" to the difficulty of assigned problems and assess students' progress. An international technological exchange workshop based on the theme of digital design is helpful to attain an accelerated heightening in the quality and experience of education. This is going to be an educational trend and increasingly prevalent in the future. A successful educational curriculum in digital design relies on a concerted effort amongst curriculum framework, learning activities, and course content. While, an internationally exchange digital design workshop is different from traditional ""semester-based"" units of curriculums. The short-term educational models are required high degrees interaction and collaboration. On the other hand, artificial neural network system that is context aware in ill-defined and complex environments is highly adaptive. It can extract, interpret and use the context information and adapt its functions to obtain an optimal correspondence between context change and desired goal efficiently. Therefore, an ANN-based pedagogical mechanism is able to encourage students to select relatively difficult design problems and promote more design originality, interaction and collaboration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
