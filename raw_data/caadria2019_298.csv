5,"The research of developing and improving pedestrian simulation model is essential in the process of analysing, evaluating and generating the architectural spaces that can not only satisfy circulation design condition but also promote sales by attracting customers. In terms of programming the simulation for commercial environment, current study attempts to use shortest-path algorithm generally and these results suggested that the model can reproduce approximate real trajectory within given environment. However, these studies also mentioned about necessity of considering shopper internal state and visual field. In this paper, in order to further incorporate the dynamic internal state (memory) into simulation model, we propose using iterative algorithm based on recurrent neural network (RNN) framework which allow it to exhibit temporal dynamic behaviour for a time sequence. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms we introduce and assess the combination of multiple algorithms and calibration of probability by comparing with trajectories of the experiment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
