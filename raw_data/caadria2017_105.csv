5,"Form-Based Codes are legal regulations adopted by local government that allow specific urban forms to be achieved. Such codes have a significant impact on the performative potential of the urban environment. This paper explores the possibility of using a neuroevolution algorithm to elucidate the complex relationship between Form-based Codes and their performative potential. More specifically, Compositional Pattern Producing Networks (CPPN) are used to generate parameter fields, which then drive the generation of varied urban models. For evolving the CPPN networks, a neuroevolution algorithm is used, called Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). In order to test the feasibility of the proposed approach, an abstract experiment is described in which a population of urban models are evolved, optimising a set of performance criteria related to the vista and location of the residential units.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
