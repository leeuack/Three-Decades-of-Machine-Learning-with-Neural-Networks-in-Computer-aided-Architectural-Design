5,"This year, for the first time in history more people are living in cities than in the country. This fact induced us to look at the topic of city modeling from different sides. In this paper we introduce novel approaches that contribute to the generation and visualization of dynamic complex urban systems. We distinguish reality-based and generic city models. On the one hand we look a three dimensional models of urban environments. On the other hand we are looking at the key challenges and trends that will shape future cities. We are drawing parallels to functional models of brain circuitry. City modeling as a case in point provides the basis for our research to arrive at a transdiciplinary theory of design and modeling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
