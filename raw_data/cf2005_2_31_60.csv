5,"While researchers learn to generate design options with a computer, the question of how a designer interacts with these options remains largely unexcavated. This paper explores how a generative system should interact with a designer. It argues that limitations in human cognition require a designer to manage the complexity of his task with a creative thinking strategy called Perception-Imagination Overlay. To support this, a generative system should present a progression of contextual design moves rather than a collection of finished solutions. After validating a set of interface requirements, the paper presents an example interface. The paper concludes that the development of computational methods cannot be legitimately isolated from the development of an appropriate designer-system interaction, and that integrating these concerns might transform our conception of generative systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
