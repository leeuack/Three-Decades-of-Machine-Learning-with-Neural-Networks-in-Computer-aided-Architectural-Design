5,"Neighborhoods are considered basic spatial units of an urban area. Their forms have complex and hierarchical structures that contain building layouts, street segments, street networks and etc.. The traditional ways of computationally producing neighborhoods have proven incompetence. Some of these conventional ways focus on the morphological approaches, but they do not include all urban features. Meanwhile, other models that can design urban features have limited formulation flexibility. Besides the absence of dynamic generation behavior as they dont use parametric techniques. They lack interactivity with the surroundings as they dont use streets as the main generator of neighborhoods. Additionally, they dont have the ability of automatically analyzing the site. Other models are generated for a specific location and miss the interactivity with other sites. This study implements parametric techniques to generate an urban model with wide design varieties. Furthermore, the model has dynamic morphological behavior, capable of interacting with the designer's modifications. This study focuses on the streets and grid as the dominant element of neighborhoods. The study also presents a predefined function in the scripting process.  The model also proposes a python switcher to allow easy accessing all the inputs. Also, the research converts the elements to be more interactive, responsive, flexible, and dynamic. Therefore, all the neighborhood elements are simultaneously created according to user requirements. The study method is divided into three stages: Decomposition, Formulation, Modeling, and evaluation. Each process is defined with its tools, inputs, and parameters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
