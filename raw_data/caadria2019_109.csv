Precedent design references have a significant role to help architects, designer and even clients in general architecture design process. Pictures are one of the representation that could exactly show a kind of design idea and knowledge. Due to the velocity, variety and volume of reference pictures data with growth of references platform, it is hard and time-consuming to handle the data with current manual way. To solve this problem , this paper depicts a deep learning-based approach to figuring out design elements and recognizing the design feature of them on the interior pictures using faster-RCNN and CNN algorithms. The targets are the residential furniture such as a table and a seating. Through proposed application, input pictures can automatically have tagging data as follows; seating1(type: sofa, seating capacity: two-seaters, design style: classic)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
