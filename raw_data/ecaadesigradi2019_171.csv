5,"This paper aims to develop a case study for training an algorithm to recognize architectural drawings. In order to succeed that, the algorithm is trained with labeled pixel-based, architectural drawing (plan and section) dataset. During the training process, transfer learning (pre-training model) is applied. The supervised learning and convolutional neural network are utilized. After certain iterations, the algorithm builds awareness and can classify pixel-based plan and section drawings. When the algorithm is shown a section that is not produced with conventional drawing technic but through hybrid technics, it could predict the drawing class correctly with %80 of accuracy. On the other hand, some of the algorithm prediction is misoriented. We examined this prediction problem in the discussion section. The results illustrate that neural networks are successful in training algorithms to recognize and classify pixel-based architectural drawings. But for a highly accurate algorithm prediction, the dataset of the drawing images must be ordered, according to sample resolution, sample size and sample coherence for the dataset.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
