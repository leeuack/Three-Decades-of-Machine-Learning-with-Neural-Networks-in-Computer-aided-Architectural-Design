5,"The waste produced in construction and demolition presents social, economic, and environmental challenges on a global scale. Research suggests that effective decision-making mechanisms are needed during preliminary design stages to minimise the production of waste. In early research, we presented a beta version of a waste reduction tool which is now in need of a User Experience (UX) and Interaction Experience (IX) strategy to meet our research aims of (a) supporting architects in making informed decisions and (b) offer general as well a specific design optimisation to reduce waste. Thus in our research, we arrived at a point that required an investigation into computational methods and strategies to meet these aims. While optimisation and decision-making in architecture are often achieved through generative design strategies, we aim to investigate and discuss alternatives. Thus we propose the hypothesis of employing augmented intelligence. The paper presents work in augmented intelligence undertaken outside the architecture discipline and presents our literature review with a discussion and conclusion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
