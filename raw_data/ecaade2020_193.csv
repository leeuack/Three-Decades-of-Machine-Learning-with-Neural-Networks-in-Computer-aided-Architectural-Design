5,"Every time an object is built, it creates a relationship with the ground. Architects have a full responsibility to design the building by taking the ground into consideration. In the field of architecture, using data mining to identify any unusual patterns or emergent architectural trends is a nascent area that has yet to be fully explored. Clustering techniques are an essential tool in this process for organising large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel proof-of-concept workflow that enables a machine learning computer system to cluster aspects of an architect's building design style with respect to how the buildings in question relate to the ground. The experimental workflow in this paper consists of two stages. In the first stage, we use a database system to collect, organise and store several significant architectural precedents. The second stage examines the most well-known unsupervised learning algorithm clustering techniques which are: K-Means, K-Modes and Gaussian Mixture Models. Our experiments demonstrated that the K-means clustering algorithm method achieves a level of accuracy that is higher than other clustering methods. This research points to the potential of AI in helping designers identify the typological and topological characteristics of architectural solutions and place them within the most relevant architectural canons",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
