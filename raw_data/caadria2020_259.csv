5,"We present a novel method for generating building geometry using deep learning techniques based on contextual geometry in urban context and explore its potential to support building massing. For contextual geometry, we opted to investigate the building footprint, a main interface between urban and architectural forms. For training, we collected GIS data of building footprints and geometries of parcels from Pittsburgh and created a large dataset of Diagrammatic Image Dataset (DID). We employed a modified version of a VGG neural network to model the relationship between (c) a diagrammatic image of a building parcel and context without the footprint, and (q) a quadrilateral representing the original footprint. The option for simple geometrical output enables direct integration with custom design workflows because it obviates image processing and increases training speed. After training the neural network with a curated dataset, we explore a generative workflow for building massing that integrates contextual and programmatic data. As trained model can suggest a contextual boundary for a new site, we used Massigner (Rhee and Chung 2019) to recommend massing alternatives based on the subtraction of voids inside the contextual boundary that satisfy design constraints and programmatic requirements. This new method suggests the potential that learning-based method can be an alternative of rule-based design methods to grasp the complex relationships between design elements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
