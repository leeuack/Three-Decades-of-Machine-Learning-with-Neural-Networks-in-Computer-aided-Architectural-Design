5,"Most of the traditional studies on urban morphology are based on aerial views. However, the 2D plane model fails to describe the height information of buildings and the relation of buildings and the urban external space. An urban section is another map of an urban area. Through a series of continuous vertical urban slices, the city texture can be transformed into planar linear information containing height and width information. This paper proposes several indicators to describe a series of urban section slices and uses a three-dimensional coordinate mapping method Sectionmatrix to quantify and analyze the relation between the physical geometrical indicators and urban form from the section perspective. Through the case analysis of multiple residential blocks in Nanjing, China, the results showed that Sectionmatrix is convenient and efficient. Sectionmatrix relates the geometrical properties to the spatial characteristics of urban areas and provides a new way to classify, map and define building typologies. This new classification method reveals the tortuosity and complexity of residential blocks. By bridging the gap between quantity and form, the research also suggests other possible applications of Sectionmatrix as a control instrument and test framework for entire cities planning and design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
