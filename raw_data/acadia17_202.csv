5,"This research builds upon a previous body of work focused on the relationship between surface geometry and heat transfer coefficients in thermal mass passive systems. It argues for the design of passive systems with higher fidelity to multivariable space between performance and perception. Rooted in the combination of form and matter, the intention is to instrumentalize design principles for the choreography of thermal gradients between buildings and their environment from experiential, spatial and topological perspectives (Figure 1).
Our work is built upon the premise that complex geometries can be used to improve both the aesthetic and thermodynamic performance of passive building systems (Cupkova and Azel 2015) by actuating thermal performance through geometric parameters primarily due to convection. Currently, the engineering-oriented approach to the design of thermal mass relies on averaged thermal calculations (Holman 2002), which do not adequately describe the nuanced differences that can be produced by complex three-dimensional geometries of passive thermal mass systems. Using a combination of computational fluid dynamic simulations with physically measured data, we investigate the relationship of heat transfer coefficients related to parameters of surface geometry. Our measured results suggest that we can deliberately and significantly delay heat absorption re-radiation purely by changing the geometric surface pattern over the same thermal mass. The goal of this work is to offer designers a more robust rule set for understanding approximate thermal lag behaviors of complex geometric systems, with a focus on the design of geometric properties rather than complex thermal calculations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
