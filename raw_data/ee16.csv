4,"The authors explore how neural networks can be used to model important aspects of design reasoning: the way design involves memory; and a 'holistic' kind of reasoning by which designs appear to emerge from that memory. A simple neural network is constructed to demonstrate how information about schemas (in this case, room types) is stored implicitly after exposure to a number of examples of specific rooms. We then demonstrate how new room types emerge from this information. The paper includes a discussion of design, a discussion of schemas from a psycholinguistic perspective, a technical explanation of neural networks and the demonstration of an implemented examples"
