4,"The present research focuses on transforming shapes that had been drawn by designers on the sketches and on evaluating the shapes from design requirements. In this research, neural networks simulate the result from collecting shapes that designers transformed from original shapes and evaluations from all ones. There are four steps in this research: First, a cognitive experiment. I collected real shapes that designers drew and evaluations from the experiment in order to training the neural networks. Second, a transforming neural network is simulating the behavior in which designers transformed one shape into another without evaluating the design requirements. Third, a evaluating neural network that trained by the evaluations that collected from the experiment is simulating how designers criticized the shapes in terms of design requirements. Fourth, modifying program is trying to modify the evaluations that had been criticized by designers from all shapes and generating a new shape from modified evaluations. This research proposed a synthetic system that simulating the behavior during design sketching, therefore, computers could also generate some ideas like human designer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
