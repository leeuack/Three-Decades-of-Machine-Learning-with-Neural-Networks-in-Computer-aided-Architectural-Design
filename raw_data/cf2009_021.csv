5,"Architecture uses technology to achieve certain functional, cultural, social, economic, and other goals. In turn, technology transforms the discipline. Information technologies promise to change design processes, practices, and products. The first uses of computing in the service of architecture have been rather timid, mimicking older practices. This is changing rapidly: new design and evaluation tools allow architects to imagine new building forms, more responsive (and environmentally more responsible) buildings, even radically new types of environments that blend physical with virtual space. Understanding and shaping this transformation are the basis of architectural design research and education in the 21st century.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
