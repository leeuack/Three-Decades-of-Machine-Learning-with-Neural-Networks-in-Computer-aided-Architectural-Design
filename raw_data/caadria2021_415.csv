5,"The process of architects exploring the program with clients often take place through face-to-face oral discussions and visual aids, such as photos and sketches. Our research focuses on two communication mediums: language and sketch. We employ machine learning techniques to assist architects and clients to improve their communication and reduce misunderstandings. We have trained a Naive Bayesian Classifier machine, the language assistant (LA), to classify architectural vocabularies with associations to design requirements. In addition, we have trained a Generative Adversarial Network, the sketch assistant (SA), to generate photo quality images based on architects' sketches. The language assistant and sketch assistant combined can facilitate architect-client communication during the pre-design stage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
