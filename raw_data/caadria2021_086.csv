5,"The main aim of this research is to harness deep learning techniques to support architectural design problems in early design phases, for example, to enable auto-completion of unfinished designs. For this purpose, we investigate the possibilities offered by established deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow. In this paper, we address a core challenge that arises, namely the transformation of semantic building information into a tensor format that can be processed by the libraries. Specifically, we address the representation of information about room types of a building and type of connection between the respective rooms. We develop and discuss five formats. Results of an initial evaluation based on a classification task show that all formats are suitable for training deep learning networks. However, a clear winner could be determined as well, for which a maximum value of 98% for validation accuracy could be achieved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
