5,"Sketching is an effective means for architects to develop design thoughts and to communicate ideas. It is a promising method for an interaction with CAAD systems that integrates naturally in the process of early conceptual design. A challenge for the realisation of sketched-based interaction, is for the computer to recognise what the designer is drawing. To inform the development of effective methods for the recognition of semantic building information in schematic layout sketches, we seek for a better understanding of how designers encode this information in their sketches. We therefore piloted a remote user study with trained architects (n=7). The results show variance in the use of symbols and in the drawing technique. However, we also observe commonalities in the approach. Participants always draw the perimeter first and then subdivide the enclosed space. We identified three techniques for subdivision: cut lines, open shapes, closed shapes. Also we identified four different types of information in participants' sketches and observed that certain types of objects are prevalent in all sketches. We discuss consequences of our observations for sketch recognition systems and considerations for the design of a follow-up study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
