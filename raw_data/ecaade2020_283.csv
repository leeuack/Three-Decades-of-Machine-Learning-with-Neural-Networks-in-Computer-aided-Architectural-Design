5,"Application of Machine Learning (ML) in the field of architecture is a worthwhile topic to discuss in the context of digital architecture. Authors propose to extend this discussion, presenting an integrated ML pipeline built with the state-of-the-art data science tools. To investigate the affordances of such pipelines, an ML model being able to predict the environmental metrics of a generalized facade system is created. This approach is valid for arbitrary facades, as long as the proposed design could be discretized in the form analogous to the data generated for the ML model training. The presented experiment evaluates the precision of the sunlight hours and radiation values predictions, aiming at the application in the early design phases. Conducted investigation builds up on the knowledge embedded in the Grasshopper and Ladybug toolsets. Potential application of Convolutional Neural Networks and categorical datasets for classifications tasks to increase the precision of the ML models have been identified. Possibility to extend the approach beyond the workspace of Rhino and Grasshopper is suggested. Further research outlook, investigating the data pattern recognition capabilities in relation to the three-dimensional forms discretized as multidimensional arrays, is stated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
