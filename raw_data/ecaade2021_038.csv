5,"Mixed reality (MR), which blends real and virtual worlds, has attracted attention as a visualization method in landscape design. MR-based landscape visualization enables stakeholders to examine landscape changes at actual scale in real-time at the actual project site. One challenge in MR-based landscape visualization is occlusion, which occurs when virtual objects obscure physical objects that are in the foreground. Previous research proposed an MR-based landscape visualization method with dynamic occlusion by using semantic segmentation of deep learning. However, this method has two problems. The first is that the same kind of objects that are grouped into one or overlapped types are classified as the same object, and the other is that the foreground objects have to be defined in pre-processing. In this study, we developed a system for large-scale MR landscape visualization that enables the recognition of each physical object individually using instance segmentation, and it is possible to accurately represent the positional relationship by comparing the coordinate information of the 3D virtual model and all physical objects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
