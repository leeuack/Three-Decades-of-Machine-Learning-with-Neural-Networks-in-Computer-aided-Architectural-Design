5,"The use of StyleGAN algorithms proposes a novel approach in the investigation of architectural images. Even though graphical outcomes produced by StyleGAN algorithms are far from being architectural spaces, they might become a starting point in the creative process of architectural projects. By creating a database of specific categories of architectural images located in certain contexts, significant findings might emerge regarding their categorization in accordance to the style of a culture. This research analyzes the architectural images that result from implementing StyleGAN algorithms in a database of images of Chilean houses built between the years 2010 and 2020 and selected as finalist of the Â´Project of the YearÂ´ from international viewers and curators of the most viewed architectural website of the world. Our findings suggest that Chilean houses have two distinctive elements strongly influenced by human bias: the proportion of voids in the architectural-like generative volume and the integration of vegetation or landscape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
