5,"Dataflow parametric modeling environments have become popular as exploratory tools due to them allowing the variational exploration of a design by controlling the parameters of its parametric model schema. However, the nature of these systems requires designers to prematurely commit to a structure and hierarchy of geometric relationships, which makes them inflexible when it comes to design exploration that requires topological changes to the parametric modeling graph. This paper is a first step towards augmenting parametric modeling systems via the use of machine learning for assisting the user towards topological exploration. In particular, this paper describes an approach where Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks, trained on a data set of parametric modeling graphs, are used as generative systems for suggesting alternative dataflow graph paths to the parametric model under development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
