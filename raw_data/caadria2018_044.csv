5,"To assess an environmental design, augmented and diminished reality (AR/DR) have a potential to build a consensus more smoothly through the landscape simulation of new design visualization of the items to be assessed, such as the green view index. However, the current system is still considered to be impractical because it does not provide complete user experience. Thus, we aim to improve the robustness of the AR/DR system and to integrate the estimation of the green view index into the AR/DR system on a game engine. Further, we achieve an improved stable tracking by eliminating the outliers of the tracking reference points using the random sample consensus (RANSAC) method and by defining the tracking reference points over an extensive area of the AR/DR display. Additionally, two modules were implemented, among which one module is used to solve the occlusion problem while the other is used to estimate the green view index. The novel integrated AR/DR system with all modules was developed on the game engine. A mock design project was developed in an outdoor environment for simulation purposes, thereby verifying the applicability of the developed system.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
