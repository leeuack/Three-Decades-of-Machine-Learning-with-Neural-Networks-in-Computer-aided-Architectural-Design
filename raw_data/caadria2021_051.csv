5,"Commercial complexes play an important role in contemporary cities, with elevators, escalators, and other paths on which people do not take natural movement in it. We consider them as spatial hyperlinking paths, which is originated from the webs hyperlinking technology. This paper studies the path network system in Taikoo Li, Sanlitun, Beijing, in three steps. Firstly, The path system is transformed into a network model, and its spatial network distribution is characterized using betweenness centrality. Secondly, a deep learning approach is used to measure the peoples flow at the selected 102 observation points. Then a multiple linear regression(MLR) analysis is conducted using the flow data as dependent variable. And there are 7 independent variables in three types, including betweenness centrality C, H1 and H2 that related to spatial hyperlinks, and B1, F1, F2, and F3 that related to floors. Thirdly, analyzing the MLR model.There are two conclusions. First, using multiple independent variables is better than one variable to fit the peoples flow distribution using the regression model. Second, escalators have the effect of enhancing peoples flow, while elevators have the opposite effect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
