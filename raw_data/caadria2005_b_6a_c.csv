5,"Design is a complex process that is information and communication intensive. In a design context, the use of knowledge technologies can assist designers in making informed design decisions. This paper reports on an educational experiment that implements an intelligent urban design aid. This experiment facilitates students to do research in a systematic way by using ICKT methods, techniques and tools in order to improve the quality of their urban design. We outline the process, describe the intelligent techniques, discuss the results of the educational experiment, and explore the approachs potential for real-life design practices.",,,,,,,,,,,,
