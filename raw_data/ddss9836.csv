5,"Can artificial intelligence be used for design behavior of human beings? Human designers behavior and design thinking are extremely complicated. There is still argument about the relationship between the two until now. Therefore, this research only investigates regular and common design behavior. This essay is taking Mondrian of Neo-Plasticism as an example and neural networks systems as a tool to illustrate the core idea. It is hoped that we can simulate the design thinking ability, such as memoryassociation and recognition of human designers. Computation of neural networks systems, as a result and the difference between human designers and computer, can be discussed too. Also, since the work of Neo-Plasticism Mondrian influences contemporary architecture design, industrial design, andvisual design directly or indirectly, floorplans of architect John Hejduks works were taken as an example to discuss the application of Neural networkss in the design field.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
