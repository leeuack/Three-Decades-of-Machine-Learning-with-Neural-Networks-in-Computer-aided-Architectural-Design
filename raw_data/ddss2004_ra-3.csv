5,"Landslides are a major natural hazard in many areas of the world, and globally  they cause hundreds of billions of dollars of damage, and hundreds of  thousands of deaths and injuries each year. Landslides are the second most  common natural hazard in Turkey, and the Black Sea region of that country is  particularly affected. Therefore, landslide susceptibility mapping is one of the  important issues for urban and rural planning in Turkey. The reliability of  these maps depends mostly on the amount and quality of available data used,  as well as the selection of a robust methodology. Although statistical methods  generally have been implemented and used for evaluating landslide  susceptibility and risk in medium scale studies, they are distribution-based and  cannot handle multi-source data that are commonly collected from nature.  These drawbacks are responsible for the on-going investigations into slope  instability. To overcome these weaknesses, the desired technique must be able  to handle multi-type data and its superiority should increase as the  dimensionality and/or non-linearity of the problem increases  which is when  traditional regression often fails to produce accurate approximations. Although  neural networks have some problems with the creation of architectures,  processing time, and the negative black box syndrome, they still have an  advantage over traditional methods in that they can deal with the problem  comprehensively and are insensitive to uncertain data and measurement errors.  Therefore, it is expected that the application of neural networks will bring new  perspectives to the assessment of landslide susceptibility in Turkey. In this  paper, the application of neural networks for landslide susceptibility mapping  will be examined and their performance as a component of spatial decision  support systems will be discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
