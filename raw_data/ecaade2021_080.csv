5,"Augmented reality (AR) in landscape design review scenarios has become an important tool that helps designers express their designs and allows stakeholders to more easily understand how the designs will look on the actual site. This study aimed to add the reflection of a virtual design model on the surface of the water in an existing AR system, thereby providing a more complete representation of the waterfront landscape design. First, we constructed an AR system using a smartphone linked to a computer. Then, a virtual surface model was predefined manually according to the water surface area on-site. A planar reflection method was introduced to generate an accurate reflection effect in real-time. Moreover, the reflection was simulated to ripple together with the water surface, providing a visually authentic look. Thus, the virtual model was able to accurately display the real-time reflection effect on the water surface in this realistic environment. Our findings indicate that future tasks could involve the implementation of other interactive optical effects for landscape design visualization, such as refraction simulation for underwater illumination design.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
