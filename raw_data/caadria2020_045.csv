5,"Machine Learning, a recently prevalent research domain in data prediction and analysis, has been widely used in a variety of fields. In the design field, especially for architectural design, a machine learning method to learn and generate design data as pixelized images has been developed in previous researches. However, proceeding pixelized image data will cause the problems of precision loss and calculation waste, since the geometric architectural design data is efficiently stored and presented as vectorized CAD files. Thus, in this article, the author developed a specific machine learning neural network to learn and predict design drawings as vectorized data, speeding up the learning and predicting process, while improving the accuracy. First, two necessary geometric tests have been successfully done, which shows the central concept of neural network construct. Then, a design rule prediction model was built to demonstrate the methods to optimize the neural network and data structure. Lastly, a generation model based on human-made design data was constructed, which can be used to predict and generate the bedroom furniture positions by inputting the boundary data of the room, door, and window.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
