5,"Digitally-generated visualizations, such as renders or movies, are, nowadays, commonly used as representation methods for architectural creations. This occurs not only in final stages of the process, with the goal of selling the product's image, but also in midst creation process to express concepts and ideas. Presently, the spread of parametric and algorithmic approaches to design creates a problem for visualization, as it enables the almost effortless change of 3D models, thus requiring repeated visualization efforts to keep up with the changes applied to the design. To solve this, we propose extending the algorithmic design approach to also include the high-level description of architectural image creation. The methodology, Algorithmic Architectural Visualization (AAV), also contemplates the required preparation settings for the visualization process, and includes possible visualization productions inspired by film techniques.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
