5,"Drawing from the philosophy of science, 'intensive' qualities define differences in degree instead of 'extensive' ones that define additive quantities. More relevant to architecture, intensive differences can define transient boundaries such as warmness and coolness, dryness and moisture, light and shadow, or visual accessibility, to name a few.The question that serves as a starting point of this study is whether the attributes mentioned above can become form-giving agents during the design process and, therefore, whether they become fundamental parameters for the conceptualization and configuration of extensive spatial qualities. This question is explored using Generative Adversarial Networks and image-to-image translation. The dataset consists of two types of images; one consists of spatial configurations representing extensive attributes. The second set depicts intensive characteristics of visual accessibility. The study proposes a conceptual model and workflow that reverses form-finding and enables the design of environments through the specification of desired intensive attributes. Furthermore, it discusses the advantage of working with this method in search of architectural environments with embedded spatial experiences.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
