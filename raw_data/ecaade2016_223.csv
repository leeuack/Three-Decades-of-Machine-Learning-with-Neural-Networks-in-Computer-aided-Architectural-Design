6,"This paper presents the foundations of a multidisciplinary design optimisation method that addresses the problem of competing wind flow profiles within urban microclimates. The simultaneous integration of architectural and urban design parameters and their aerodynamic constraints are investigated. Differences in the height of tall buildings, which define the urban canopy layer are accounted for. The formulation that supports the simulation of aerodynamic forces at the architectural and urban scales includes multidisciplinary parameter specification of 2D and 3D building geometry, spatial morphology, spatial topology, wind flow settings, and wind flow compliance. The MDO framework and its development are discussed relative to their generative performance-based capacity and innovative approach to multidisciplinary wind flow optimization",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
