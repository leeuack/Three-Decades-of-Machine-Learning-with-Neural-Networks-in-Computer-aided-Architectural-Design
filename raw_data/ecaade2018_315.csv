5,"This paper discusses the ability to apply machine learning to the combinatorial design-assembly at the scale of a building to urban form. Connecting the historical lines of discrete automata in computer science and formal studies in architecture this research contributes to the field of additive material assemblies, aggregative architecture and their possible upscaling to urban design. The following case studies are a preparation to apply deep-learning on the computational descriptions of urban form. Departing from the game Go as a testbed for the development of deep-learning applications, an equivalent platform can be designed for architectural assembly. By this, the form of a building is defined via the overlap between separate building parts. Building on part-relations, this research uses mereology as a term for a set of recursive assembly strategies, integrated into the design aspects of the building parts. The models developed by research by design are formally described and tested under a digital simulation environment. The shown case study shows the process of how to transform geometrical elements to architectural parts based merely on their compositional aspects either in horizontal or three-dimensional arrangements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
