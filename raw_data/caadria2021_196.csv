5,"In this paper, a novel synthetic workflow is presented for procedural generation of room relation graphs of floor plans from structured architectural datasets. Different from classical floor plan generation models, which are based on strong heuristics or low-level pixel operations, our method relies on parsing vectorized floor plans to generate their intended organizational graph for further graph-based deep learning. This research work presents the schema for the organizational graphs, describes the generation algorithms, and analyzes its time/space complexity. As a demonstration, a new dataset called CubiGraph5K is presented. This dataset is a collection of graph representations generated by the proposed algorithms, using the floor plans in the popular CubiCasa5K dataset as inputs. The aim of this contribution is to provide a matching dataset that could be used to train neural networks on enhanced floor plan parsing, analysis and generation in future research.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
