5,"The potential afforded by the open search spaces of both agent-based models and evolutionary engines have given architecture yet another set of computational tools to play with, yet more often than not, they are used in isolation from one another.  This research explores the set of techniques and results of having combined swarm formations, FEM software and an evolutionary engine within a parametric modeling environment such that they induce structurally intelligent swarm (SIS) morphologies.  These morphologies are situated within normative architectural assemblies by means of parametric grafting techniques.  Savage gothic materiality, as described by John Ruskin, as well as the work of Eva Hesse are referenced as the basis for these explorations.  Speculations are made as to refining the engineering capabilities, expanding on programmatic applications and testing integrated SIS assemblies at larger scales.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
