5,"This paper describes an approach to utilizing natural language processing (NLP) to capture design requirements from the natural language-based architectural documents. In various design stage of the architectural process, there are several different kinds of documents describing requirements for buildings. Capturing the design requirements from those documents is based on extracting information of objects, their properties, and relations. Until recently, interpreting and extracting that information from documents are almost done by a manual process. To intelligently automate the conventional process, the computer has to understand the semantics of natural languages. In this regards, this paper suggests an approach to utilizing NLP for semantic analysis which enables the computer to understand the semantics of the given text data. The proposed approach has following steps: 1) extract noun words which mostly represent objects and property data in Korean Building Act; 2) analyze the semantic relations between words, using NLP and deep learning; 3) Based on domain database, translate the noun words in objects and properties data and find out their relations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
