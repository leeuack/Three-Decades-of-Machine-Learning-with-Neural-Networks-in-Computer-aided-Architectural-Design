5,"This paper aims to propose deep learning-based approach to the auto-recognition of their design features of interior design elements using given digital images. The recently image recognition technique using convolutional neural networks has shown great success in the various field of research and industry. The open-source frameworks and pre-trained image recognition models supporting image recognition task enable us to easily retrain the models to apply them on any domain. This paper describes how to apply such techniques on interior design process and depicts some demonstration results in that approaches. Furniture that is one of the most common interior design elements has sub-feature including implicit design features, such as style, shape, function as well as explicit properties, such as component, materials, and size. This paper shows to retrain the model to extract some of the features for efficiently managing and utilizing such design information. The target element is chair and the target design features are limited to functional features, materials, seating capacity and design style. Total 3933 chair images dataset and 6 retrained image recognition models were utilized for retraining. Through the combination of those multiple models, inference demonstration also has been described.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
