5,"Our prediction model is based on the development of Semantic Location Model. It embodies geometrical and topological information which can increase the efficiency in prediction and make it easy to manipulate the prediction model. Data mining is being implemented to extract the inhabitant's location patterns generated day by day. As a result, the self-learning system will be able to semantically predict the inhabitant's location in advance. This context-aware system brings about the key component of the ubiquitous computing environment. First, we explain the semantic location model and data mining methods. Then the location prediction model for the ubiquitous computing system is described in details. Finally, the prototype system is introduced to demonstrate and evaluate our prediction model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
