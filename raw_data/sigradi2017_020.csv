5,"The aim of this paper is to expose the preliminary results of a research about local landscape perception for students in a rural school. The proposed methodology implies an analysis and elaboration of landscape maps, regarding the use of new technologies in order to understand them. This work was done through remote visualization tools to determinate landscape parameters and other necessary inputs to evaluate the incidence of digital tools on students perception. Digital photographs, drone flights and interactive platforms are also applied as innovative tools to navigate and understand landscape from different scales and approaches.",,,,,,,,,,,,
