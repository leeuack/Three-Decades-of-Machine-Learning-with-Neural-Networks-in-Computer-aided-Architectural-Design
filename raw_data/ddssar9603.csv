5,"There is a dearth of software able to support the working styles of all types of designers and design scholars, spanning the whole spectrum of hermeneutical and empirical traditions. The development of morphogenetic designing in architecture opens new possibilities to bridge the gap between the different traditions. It can support the birth of forms evolving one from the other with the help of local and global rules in genetic algorithms and neural networks which translate the wishes of the designer. It can also support the communication about these forms and the testing of their adequacy. On the other hand the design process which is reflected in the sequence of form generating acts can be studied by design researchers better than by protocols alone."
