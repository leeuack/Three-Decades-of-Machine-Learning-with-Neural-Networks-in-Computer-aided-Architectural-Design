5,"This research will develop a simplified surfaces roughness measurement system STMSto be used in subtractive CAM processes.This STMS system will involve a solid modeling approach to measure tolerances through CAD comparison procedures, plus the addition of real texture profiles for metrology purposes. The CAD comparison will be performed between the input CAD model (part to be machined) and the output machined model after simulation. The addition of real textures will report levels of surfaces' roughnessbased on standards. To do so, the STMS system will access standard texture databases from an organism of standardization (ex. ISO or ASME). The parameters taken form those databases will be translated in texture profiles and applied as general texture patterns to the output model. After those procedures, the outcomes of the system will be a report about tolerances and roughness of the machined model?s surface, and a realistic textured model useful for virtual mockups, visual inspections as well as design intent checking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
