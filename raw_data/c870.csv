5,"Architectural design requires a variety of representations to describe the many expressions a building can be observed through. Commonly, the form and space of a building are represented through the visual abstraction of projective
geometry. The medium of geometric representation has become synonymous with architectural space.
The introduction of computational design in architecture has not changed our understanding or representation of architectural space, only of its geometric description and production processes. The addition of the computer as a medium should allow us to open new ways of seeing since the medium allows for novel descriptions and expressions via data processing hitherto impossible. This paper would like to propose some computational methods that could potentially describe and generate non-geometric but rather phenomenal expressions of architectural space."
