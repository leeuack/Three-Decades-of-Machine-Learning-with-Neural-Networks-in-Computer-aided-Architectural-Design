5,"In this study, the serious game is conceptualized as a digital medium to convert archaeological knowledge into playable interactions via a case study in the ancient city of Teos. The Teos of Dionysos Game is a digital platform that allows players without specialist computer skills to explore the archaeological knowledge and experience an ancient urban setup. A mythological story about the God Dionysos has been verbally and visually transcribed and adapted for four distinctive settings of this ancient site. The familiar realm of an interactive space, navigated by intuitive behaviours in a game setting, conveys archaeological data, allowing players to build an empathic understanding of ancient architecture. Diverse stakeholders have already tested a mobile game prototype in a workshop, which explored whether those without a prior historical background can advance their existing knowledge through activities that aim at providing entertainment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
