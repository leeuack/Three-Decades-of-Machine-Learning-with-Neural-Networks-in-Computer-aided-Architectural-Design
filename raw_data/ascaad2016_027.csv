5,"The term ""Parametricism"" widespread mainly by Patrick Schumacher (Schumacher, 2008) is worthy of study. Developing the concept of Human Oriented Parametric Architecture, the need of implementing time as the lost parameter in current adaptive design techniques will be discussed. Morphogenetic processes ideas will be discussed through the principle of an adaptable membrane as a case study. A model implementing a unique Arduino[i] on the façade will control its patterns performance through an Artificial Neural Network that will understand the kind of scenario the building is in, activating a Genetic Algorithm that will optimize the insulation performance of the ETFE pillows. The system will work with a global behavior for façade pattern performance and with a local one for each pillow, giving the option of individual sun-shading control. Machine learning implementation will give the façade the possibility to learn from the efficacy of its decisions through time, eliminating the need of a general on-off behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
