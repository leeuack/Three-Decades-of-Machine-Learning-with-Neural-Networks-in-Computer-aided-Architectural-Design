4,"Neural networks and fuzzy techniques are among the most promising approaches to pattern recognition. Neuro-fuzzy systems aim at combining the advantages of the two paradigms. This book is a collection of papers describing state-of-the-art work in this emerging field. It covers topics such as feature selection, classification, classifier training, and clustering. Also included are applications of neuro-fuzzy systems in speech recognition, land mine detection, medical image analysis, and autonomous vehicle control. The intended audience includes graduate students in computer science and related fields, as well as researchers at academic institutions and in industry."
