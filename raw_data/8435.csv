4,Two tools for storing and recalling information in computer systems are discussed and demonstrated in relation to design. The tools are hypermedia and neural networks. Each provides a valuable model for reasoning by the association of ideas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
