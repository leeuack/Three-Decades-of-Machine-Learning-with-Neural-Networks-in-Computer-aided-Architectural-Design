5,"Spatial configurations can be perceived through a variety of descriptions of their physical form and structure. Each description can offer an autonomous interpretation or be combined with others parathetically, in a logic of multiple distinct layers. However it is asserted that meaningful information can be extracted from a simultaneous view of sets of descriptions within a high-dimensional structure. This paper investigates the possibility of conducting a comparative analysis and classification of non-typical spatial formations based on the synchronous view of multiple quantifiable spatial attributes. Under the hypothesis of a reciprocal definition of spatial structure and occupation practices, it is intended to identify distinct generic spatial types in order to subsequently determine a range of suitable respective generic use types. This investigation supports the formulation of strategies for the reactivation of unused, residual urban voids, currently being addressed by the research programme titled ""Strategies to network urban interventions in the Metropolitan Centre of Athens"". The programme is carried out by the School of Architecture of the National Technical University of Athens in collaboration with the Region of Attica, under the scientific coordination of Professor Dr. Parmenidis (2013).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
