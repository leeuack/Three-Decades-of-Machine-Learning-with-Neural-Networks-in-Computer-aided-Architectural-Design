5,"Over the past 13 years, the 'World16'-group has collaborated face-to-face on various challenges that architectural design faces within VR, architecture, urban design, and its delivery to the professional industries. The focus of the collaboration is to foster pathways of academic research and developments to industries and professions. In 2020, due to the restrictions of the pandemic, the group had to rethink and redevelop how to collaborate meaningfully and become resilient: the World16 collaborated akin to the Virtual Design Studios (VDS) of the Nineties for the first time exclusively virtually becoming the 'Virtual World16'. The paper presents the group's various projects that are transformative to the praxis in VR architecture, design and urban design, and critically reflects on the lessons learned from VDS-paradigm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
