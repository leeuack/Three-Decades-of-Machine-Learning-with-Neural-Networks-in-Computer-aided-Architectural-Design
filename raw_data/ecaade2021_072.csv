5,"Building's spatial structure described in a BIM model can be used for retrieving the information required for determining the shortest path within the building. The matrix method and the visibility method are the two main ways of dividing space into prime factors. Both are widely used to find the shortest path. In order to compare the performance of both methods, several tests were carried out with various versions of the floorplan modification (room area, the surface of internal walls, distance between the entrance, and exit in a straight line and within the boundary marked by walls of the maze). The results revealed significant differences between the visibility graph and the matrix method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
