5,"In the processes of continues functional differentiation the contemporary society increasingly displays the characteristics of complex, distributed systems. In this condition architecture can no longer rely on top-down reductionist methodologies in ignoring the constituting importance of contextual parameters. The present paper describes how Artificial Neural Networks can be employed to design with-in the underlying logic of our society -the logic of distributed systems. In computer simulations the paper explores the capability of ANN to Self-organization: Neural Networks Architectures absorb and adapt vast amount of urban data in order to adjust their organization to exterior changes through interior structural reconfiguration, thus producing adaptive spatial formations."
