4,"Evaluation can be defined as measuring the fit between achieved (or expected) performances and stated criteria. It is complicated by the multi-criteria and multi-level modalities of design, where an overall balance of performances is preferred to maximizing the performance of a few characteristics, and where evaluation must be performed at different design phases, each characterized by a different informational profile. Each design modality requires a different approach to evaluation: the Multi-Criteria modality requires evaluation of a proposed solution at a particular design phase from multiple points of view, while the Multi-Level modality requires the evaluation of a particular performance characteristic at several different design phases. This paper discusses the multi-modal nature of evaluation and prediction in design, exemplified by some of the approaches that have been proposed to support them computationally. It then argues for the need to develop an integrated, multi-modal design evaluation paradigm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
