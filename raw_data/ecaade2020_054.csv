5,"Healthy urban planning is about planning for people, considering the needs of people and communities during the planning process and the implications of decisions for human health and well-being. However, access to real electronic health record (EHR) data is hindered by legal, privacy, security, and intellectual property restrictions. The lack of freely distributable health records has become an important issue for healthy urban planning. This research develops a source of synthetic electronic health records based on reviewed and meta-analysed evidence on the association between built environmental characteristics related to lifestyle chronic diseases. This research uses Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) as health for proof of concept. The results roughly approximate age and gender groups at diagnosis curves (R2 = 0.876), and correctly generated more than 90% of patients for the all age group in Singapore. As a summary, these pilot validated synthetic records could be used as a risk-free (no privacy & security issues) data for supporting healthy urban planning.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
