5,"Virtual reality (VR) has been suggested for various purposes in the field of architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC). This research explores new roles for VR toward the super-smart society in the near future. In particular, we propose to develop post-processing rendering, segmentation-rendering and shadow-casting rendering algorithms for novel VR expressions to enable more versatile approaches than the normal photorealistic red, green, and blue (RGB) expressions. We succeeded in applying a wide variety of VR renderings in urban-design projects after implementation. The developed system can create images in real time to train deep-learning algorithms, can also be applied to landscape analysis and contribute to advanced user experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
