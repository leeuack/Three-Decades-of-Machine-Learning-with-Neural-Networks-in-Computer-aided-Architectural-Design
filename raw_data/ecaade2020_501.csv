5,The aim of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy of the Digital Twin approach to achieving Sentient buildings able to develop preservation and conservation action plans from environmental data. The case study is based on the integration of an H-BIM model with an AI-based Decision Support System implementing Machine Learning techniques for conserving museum collections in historical buildings.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
