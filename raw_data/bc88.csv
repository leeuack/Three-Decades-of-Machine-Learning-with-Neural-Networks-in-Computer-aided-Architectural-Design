5,"Marshall McLuhan once said in his book Understanding Media that Environments are invisible. Their ground rules evade easy perception. Evasive perception leads to fuzzy representations as shown through Kevin Lynchs mental maps and the Situationists psycho-geographies. Eventually, spatial representations have to be described through abstractions based on some embedded rules of environmental
interaction. These rules and methods of abstraction serve to understand cognition of space.
The Centre for Evolutionary Computing in Architecture (CECA) at the University of East London has focused for the last 5 years on methods of cognitive spatial descriptions, based largely on either behavioural patterns or topological machines. The former being agent based, the latter neural network based.
This years selection of student work constitutes a combination of cognitive agents + perceptive networks, and comprises three theses."
