5,"The transmission technologies of digital environments propagated by the Internet, specifically the ubiquitous webcam system, present new material to mediate peoples engagement with civic space and simultaneously offer new ways to materialize its three-dimensional form. Recent research shows that the technical functionality of the webcam can be extended through deliberate intervention within the performance of contemporary camera optics. This suggests the development of new techniques for design intervention that operate in direct relationship to the evolution of the very technologies they exploit. With specific focus on the optical and chromatic translational capacities of the camera, the paper will discuss how the manipulation of its colour receptor mechanism not only provides the designer with an opportunity to exceed the constraints of commonly available colour palettes, but also it will show how this digital disruption actively capitalises upon the discrepancies that govern design strategies applied to formal production within coexistent virtual and real-time space. Through the deployment of colour filter array patterns, this new technique is able to extend the working gamut of RGB colour space in a way that that allows chromatic selection for exterior and interior urban space to be linked to programmatic distribution across duplicate environments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
