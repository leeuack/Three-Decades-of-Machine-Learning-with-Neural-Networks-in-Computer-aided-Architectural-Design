5,"The disconnection between architectural form and materiality has become an important issue in recent years. Architectural form is mainly decided by the designer, while material data, for example, the natural shape of source materials, is often treated as an afterthought which doesn't factor in decision-making directly. This study proposes a new, real-time scanning-modeling system for obtaining material information, and incorporating the data into a continuous digital chain of computational design and robotic construction. After collecting and visualizing the data, the calculation portion of the chain processes the selection of source materials and generates architectural geometry based on both human-designed rules and various shapes of materials. Finally, at the action end of the chain, an industry robot is used to fabricate the design. End-effector is designed for tightly gripping the irregular source materials. Scripts is written in Grasshopper for positioning the components and assemble them into configurations. This study also shows a pavilion developing with the continuous digital chain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
