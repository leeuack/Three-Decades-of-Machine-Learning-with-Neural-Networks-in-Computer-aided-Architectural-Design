5,"As the development of a computer and the internet have changed social and economic activities related with the human life style. According to these changes, ubiquitous residential environments have been discussed. This paper presents ways of interpreting the situation in association with human interaction with residential environments. This paper deals with various operations of architectural components based on a sensor based context awareness. The methods adopted in this paper for suitable services corresponding to residents requirements are Pattern Driven Inference(PDI), Rule Driven Inference(RDI) and Case Driven Inference(CDI). In summary, this paper describes processes how services are provided. And Context based residential management is main research issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
