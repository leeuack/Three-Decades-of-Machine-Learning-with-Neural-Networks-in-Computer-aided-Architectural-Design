5,"In the recent decades, the high-resolution remote sensing, through 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry benefited historic buildings maintenance, conservation, and restoration works. However, the dense surface models (DSM) generated from the data capture have nonstructured features as lack of topology and semantic discretization. The process to create a semantically oriented 3D model from the DSM, using the of Building Information Model technology, is a possibility to integrate historical information about the life cycle of the building to maintain and improving architectural valued building stock to its functional level and safeguarding its outstanding historical value. Our approach relies on an ontology-based system to represent the knowledge related to the building. Our work outlines a model-driven approach based on the hybrid data acquisition, its post-processing, the identification of the building' main features for the parametric modeling, and the development of an ontological map integrated with the BIM model. The methodology proposed was applied to a large-scale industrial historical building, located in Brazil. The DSM were compared, providing a qualitative assessment of the proposed method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
