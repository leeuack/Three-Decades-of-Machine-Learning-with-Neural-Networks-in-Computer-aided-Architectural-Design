5,"Analogy is thought to be foundational for designing and for design creativity. Nonetheless, practicing analogical reasoning needs a knowledge-base. The paper proposes a framework for constructing a knowledge-base of urban constructs that builds on an ontology of urbanism. The framework is composed of two modules that are responsible for representing either the concepts or the features of any urban constructs' materialization. The concepts are represented as a knowledge graph (KG) named SpatialNet, while the physical features are represented by a deep neural network (DNN) called SpatialFeaturesNet. For structuring SpatialNet, as a KG that comprehensively conceptualizes spatial qualities, deep learning applied to natural language processing (NLP) is employed. The comprehensive concepts of SpatialNet are firstly discovered using semantic analyses of nine English lingual corpora and then structured using the urban ontology. The goal of the framework is to map the spatial features to the plethora of their matching concepts. The granularity Ã nd the coherence of the proposed framework is expected to sustain or substitute other known analogical, knowledge-based, inspirational design approaches such as case-based reasoning (CBR) and its analogical application on architectural design (CBD).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
