4,This paper discusses the boundary contour system as the basis of a computational model of emergent recognition applicable in design. Details of this system which make it appealing as a computational approach for emergent recognition are introduced. The performance of a system implementation is covered and an extension to improve its performance is discussed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
