5,"This paper looks at a new way of employing unsupervised neural networks in the design of an architectural system. The method described involves looking the whole lifecycle of a building and its coupling with its environment.
Techniques such as dimensionality reduction, it is argued, are well suited to architectural design whereby complex problems are commonplace. An example project is explored - that of an exhibition space where multiple ephemeral exhibitions are housed at any given time. A modified growing neural gas algorithm is employed in order cognize similarities of spaces whose nature are not known a priori. By utilising the machine, a coupling between the building system and the users of the space is explored throughout the whole project life of the design."
