5,"The topic of this paper is about a technique to turn pictures into an intuitively modifiable 3D model. The research employs an analytical method using algorithms to conceptualise and digital- ise architectural spaces in order to highlight parametric shapes. Usual- ly, from one group of digital photos, photogrammetry techniques pro- duce a 3D-model mesh through a high-density 3D point cloud. This discordance between our intuitive partitioning of the mesh and its bare polygonal structure makes it interact poorly compared to the af- fordance of shape and component in our daily experience. Through a capture device, a visualisation of architecture in a digital data form is produced. They are processed by computer vision algorithms and ma- chine learning systems in order to be refined into a parametric model. Parametric elements can be described as a compound of formulas and parameters. By keeping the formula and changing the parameters, the- se elements can be easily modified in a range of likenesses. After be- ing detected during scans, these shapes can be adapted to fit the inten- tion of the designer during the design phase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
