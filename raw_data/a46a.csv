Considering the context of Hong Kong with a hot-humid sub-tropical climate and hyper-dense urban environment, the current approach in the design studio education has been mainly based on intuition with very limited supports in terms of technical know-how and scientific evidence. Many students of architecture tend to follow established paradigms that have evolved through experience with similar projects. In this paper, we report the research findings of a pilot study that applied advanced scientific simulation skills in studio education designed to help students explore environmental design strategies during early stages of project design development.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
