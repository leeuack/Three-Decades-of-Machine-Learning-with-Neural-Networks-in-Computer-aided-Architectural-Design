5,"Because of the special geography features and subtropics weather in Taiwan,  we need to provide correct information to help people making decision when  they are in disaster. So the disaster decision support system must offer proper  information of evacuation path to people. This research has shown the  difficulties associated with the GIS and the flooding evacuation path search  through the huge searching space generated during the network analysis  process. This research also presents an approach to these problems by utilizing  a search process whose concept is derived from natural genetics. Genetic  algorithms (GAs) have been introduced in the optimization problem solving  area by Holland (1975) and Goldberg (1989) and have shown their usefulness  through numerous applications. We apply GA and GIS to choice flooding  evacuation path in metropolitan area in this study. We take the region of Shiji  city in Taiwan for case. Firstly, we establish the node relationship of GA  calculation, the level of the weight is the standard of the date that is exported  by Disaster Database. Secondly, we apply GA to calculate different  evacuation path in different time series. Finally, we build the model of  choosing flooding evacuation path.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
