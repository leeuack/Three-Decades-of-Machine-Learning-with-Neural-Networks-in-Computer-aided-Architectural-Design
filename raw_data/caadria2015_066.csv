5,"Architectural survey is an evolving field in architecture that has been affected during the past decades by the technological advancements in the field of 3D data acquisition. Data acquired from laser scanning and photogrammetry, for the purposes of documentation can be integrated in the BIM data base of the project and contribute as the first stage in the sustainable process of building reuse and retrofit and for an appropriate design intervention for a building under preservation. This paper presents the case study of the documentation and design intervention of a building under preservation in Ramat Gan, Israel. All phases of the design process were integrated into a comprehensive BIM data base: the digital documentation of the building, through laser scanning and photogrammetry, the architectural geometry, the structural information, the HVAC and electrical planning. This case-study demonstrates how the compilation of the various phases in a BIM database facilitated a smooth workflow in a complicated project under preservation, allowed for an immediate coordination between the various consultants and resulted in a non-invasive design intervention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
